# Project: Data Modelling with Postgres
> Project 1 of Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree

## Introduction
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They'd like a Data Engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

## Project Description
In this project, you'll apply what you've learned on data modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. To complete the project, you will need to define fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.

## Project Datasets
### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
data/song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
data/song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

Below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

`{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}`

### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
```
data/log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
data/log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

Also below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Project Files
The project is sectioned into six files as described below;
1. `test.ipynb` displays the first few rows of each table to let you check your database.
2. `create_tables.py` creates the sparkifydb database, drops and creates the tables. Run this file to reset your tables before each time you run your ETL scripts.
3. `etl.ipynb` This notebook contains detailed instructions of the ETL process development for each of the tables.
4. `etl.py` reads and processes files from `song_data` and `log_data` and loads them into your tables. The file contains code extracted from the etl.ipynb notebook.
5. `sql_queries.py` contains all your sql queries, and is imported into the last three files above.
6. `README.md` provides discussion on your project.

## Database Schema for Song Play Analysis
The json files from the song and log datasets are stored in a denormalized database with star schema. The star schema separates business process data into fact tables (`songplays`), which hold the measurable, quantitative data about a business, and dimension tables (`users`, `songs`, `artists`, and `time`), which are descriptive attributes related to fact data.

The justification for using the star-schema lies in the following benefits of star-schema denormalization
1. **Simpler queries** – star-schema join-logic is generally simpler than the join logic required to retrieve data from a highly normalized transactional schema.
2. **Simplified business reporting logic** – when compared to highly normalized schemas, the star schema simplifies common business reporting logic, such as period-over-period and as-of reporting.
3. **Query performance gains** – star schemas can provide performance enhancements for read-only reporting applications when compared to highly normalized schemas.
4. **Fast aggregations** – the simpler queries against a star schema can result in improved performance for aggregation operations.
5. **Feeding cubes** – star schemas are used by all OLAP systems to build proprietary OLAP cubes efficiently; in fact, most major OLAP systems provide a ROLAP mode of operation which can use a star schema directly as a source without building a proprietary cube structure.

## ETL Process
![etl process](/images/etl.JPG "ETL Process")

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is general process that takes raw data from one or more sources, extracts the information required for analysis, transforms the data into a format that can serve business needs, and loads the data to a data warehouse or final destination. This process is usually automated via an ETL pipeline.

### ETL Pipeline
The ETL pipeline extracts the song and log files from the following directories
* /data/song_data
* /data/log_data

and the ETL process is performed in the following sequence
1. From a terminal (ensure you are in the right directory), run **`python create_tables.py`**. 
 * the `DROP` statements in **`sql_queries.py`** drops the sparkifydb database and its tables if they exist
 * the `CREATE` statements in **`sql_queries.py`** creates and initializes the sparkifydb database and its tables
2. Run the jupyter notebook **`test.ipynb`** to verify creation of the tables in the sparkifydb database. Ensure to restart the kernel to close connection to the database after running this notebook.
3. From the terminal, run **`python etl.py`** to extract, transform and load the data into the sparkfydb database.
4. Run **`test.ipynb`** to verify the records were successfully inserted into each table. Ensure to rerun **`python create_tables.py`** to reset the tables before running the test.ipynb notebook.


## Example Query
The following SQL query gets the number of songs per year after 1993 from the `songs` table.

`%sql SELECT count(songs.song_id), songs.year FROM songs WHERE songs.year>1993 GROUP BY songs.year ORDER BY songs.year`
